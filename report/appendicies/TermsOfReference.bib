	abstract = {This report documents progress against Courtauld 2025 and UN’s Sustainable Development
Goal (SDG) 12.3 food waste prevention targets, and also the Courtauld 2025 greenhouse gas
emissions (GHG) target1. The analysis suggests that the UK is on a trajectory to
achieve national and international food waste prevention targets, assuming rates
of progress between 2007 and 2018 are maintained, and that the strategies
WRAP has developed under Courtauld 2025, delivered through wide-ranging
partnerships and supported by industry are effective. When consumers and
businesses are reached and motivated to act significant reductions are achieved.
Much more action is needed to ensure that most people and organisations are
engaged and making the required changes.
WRAP, food businesses and other partners have delivered large-scale interventions to reduce
food waste across supply chains, and households for more than ten years (since 2007),
supported by UK Governments and enabled by a series of collaborative voluntary
agreements. This contributed to a decrease in post-farm gate total food waste between 2007
and 2015 of around a million tonnes. Whilst being recognised as world-leading2, progress in
reducing household food waste stalled between 2012 and 2015, and only modest reductions
were made in supply chain food waste. Courtauld 2025 was launched in 2016 with a new
collaborative approach to increase the resource efficiency of the food supply chain.
This report shows that food waste in the UK (post-farm gate) amounted to around 9.5 Mt in
2018, almost 480kt lower than in 2015 and almost 1.7 Mt lower than in the SDG12.3
baseline year. Food waste excluding inedible parts amounted to around 6.4 Mt in 2018, or
almost 70\% of the total.},
