\textbf{\underline{PROJECT E LOGBOOK INSTRUCTIONS}}

This eLogbook can be used to record the progress of work on the project. It covers all the stages of the
work and it is strongly recommended that it be \ul{completed in full by the student.}

\textit{
    Note: if this eLogbook is not used by the student, \ul{a suitable alternative should be adopted in agreement with
    the Project Supervisor;} the alternative should be accessible by the project tutor if the need arises and able
    to be included as electronic appendices in the final dissertation submission (e.g. consider how the alternative
    can be exported).
}

This eLogbook or other form of project log should be submitted upon completion of the project.
You should also use excerpts from it to evidence claims made in the evaluation section of your report.

\textbf{BEFORE EACH MEETING}

Before each meeting, \textbf{\ul{YOU} must complete the following sections of the relevant weekly log form
(\colorbox{\logbookshadecolour}{shaded in orange}) and \ul{SHARE} the revised complete eLogbook with your Supervisor
(e.g. via email, shared file space):}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Date and time of the meeting;
    \item Brief description of work done since the last meeting;
    \item Number of hours spent on the project since the last meeting;
    \item Questions/items to discuss at the meeting (agenda).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{AFTER EACH MEETING}

\textbf{By the end of the meeting, YOU and your SUPERVISOR must complete the other parts of the form for the week
(not shaded).} After the remaining sections are completed during the meeting, the revised eLogbook should be once
again saved and shared (i.e. via email or shared file space).

If, for any reason, you have more than one meeting in a week or hold a meeting outside of teaching weeks,
simply copy and paste a blank table to create a new entry, taking care to place it in chronological order and
change the heading to something meaningful. For example, if you have two meetings in one week you could use
Week 3a and Week 3b or Week 3.1 and Week 3.2 to indicate the occurrences; alternatively, if you meet outside
allocated teaching weeks for any reason, you could add the meeting date to the heading.

It is recommended that you use the \enquote*{Navigation Pane} in Word to provide easy and quick access to each respective
log form and/or other component.  On the top menu, simply select \enquote*{View} and tick the \enquote*{Navigation Pane} box, which
is located in the \enquote*{Show} section towards the left-hand side.
