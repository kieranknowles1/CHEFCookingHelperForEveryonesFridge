Student Project Ethics Approval Form
You should use this document if your project is not high risk. Please complete this document and discuss your study
with your supervisor before you collect any data. \ul{\textit{Failure to complete this document and have all aspects signed
off and approved by your supervisor and 2nd marker results in a fail in your final module result and may risk a
case of Academic Misconduct.}}

Please ensure that your project meets the conditions of the existing module level ethics application
(available on Blackboard). If it does not, then you will need to submit a full ethics application instead
via the main university ethics system.

\subsection{Risk Assessment, Health and Safety}
All research activity carried out by Northumbria University is subject to risk assessment and health and safety issues. Depending on the nature of your research work, you may need to use one of the risk assessments below and/or complete a Project Risk Assessment in discussion with your supervisor. Once you have identified risks and associated health and safety issues, you may need to consult relevant technical and other staff for further advice and guidance. Further information including a blank risk assessment form for research can be found here: Risk Assessment (northumbria.ac.uk).
Please check this box after you have read and understood ethics and health and safety information
\checkbox{empty}   I confirm I have read the University's health and safety policy and ethics policy. I have read and understood the requirement for the mandatory completion of risk assessments and that my study does not deviate from the module level approval ethics information on Blackboard:  Relevant risk assessments are listed in the ethics application. If your project needs additional risk assessments, then you will need to submit a new ethics application. Please identify the elements of the listed risk assessment that are relevant for your study and the risk assessment(s) you are working with. Note that these are only relevant if you are collecting data face-to-face.
