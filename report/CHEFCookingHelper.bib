	abstract = {This report documents progress against Courtauld 2025 and UN’s Sustainable Development
Goal (SDG) 12.3 food waste prevention targets, and also the Courtauld 2025 greenhouse gas
emissions (GHG) target1. The analysis suggests that the UK is on a trajectory to
achieve national and international food waste prevention targets, assuming rates
of progress between 2007 and 2018 are maintained, and that the strategies
WRAP has developed under Courtauld 2025, delivered through wide-ranging
partnerships and supported by industry are effective. When consumers and
businesses are reached and motivated to act significant reductions are achieved.
Much more action is needed to ensure that most people and organisations are
engaged and making the required changes.
WRAP, food businesses and other partners have delivered large-scale interventions to reduce
food waste across supply chains, and households for more than ten years (since 2007),
supported by UK Governments and enabled by a series of collaborative voluntary
agreements. This contributed to a decrease in post-farm gate total food waste between 2007
and 2015 of around a million tonnes. Whilst being recognised as world-leading2, progress in
reducing household food waste stalled between 2012 and 2015, and only modest reductions
were made in supply chain food waste. Courtauld 2025 was launched in 2016 with a new
collaborative approach to increase the resource efficiency of the food supply chain.
This report shows that food waste in the UK (post-farm gate) amounted to around 9.5 Mt in
2018, almost 480kt lower than in 2015 and almost 1.7 Mt lower than in the SDG12.3
baseline year. Food waste excluding inedible parts amounted to around 6.4 Mt in 2018, or
almost 70\% of the total.},

	abstract = {In the literature, various collaborative filtering approaches have been developed to perform an efficient recommendation on top of reducing the search cost of the customers. The recommender system methods are concentrated on improving the accuracy and to achieve that goal they focused on formulating complex similarity approaches and neglect the computation time in their model. Furthermore, in order to compute the similarity metric, most of traditional similarity measures have only considered co-rated items and overlooked the total rating vector of the user or item. However, considering only co-rated items to measure similarity metrics in recommender system is an insignificant approach to identifying appropriate nearest neighbors in relatively sparse datasets. Therefore, in this research, two new simple but effective similarity models have been developed by considering all rating vectors of users to classify relevant neighborhoods and generate recommendations in a lower computation time. Moreover, MovieLens, a well-known dataset used in recommender system domain, is involved here to validate the performance of the proposed model. It seems that the proposed relevant Jaccard similarity perform more accurately and effectively to generate well recommendation than other traditional similarity models.},

The models are efﬁcient and result in accurate performance on diverse transfer tasks. Two variants of the encoding models allow for trade-offs between accuracy and compute resources. For both variants, we investigate and report the relationship between model complexity, resource consumption, the availability of transfer task training data, and task performance. Comparisons are made with baselines that use word level transfer learning via pretrained word embeddings as well as baselines do not use any transfer learning. We ﬁnd that transfer learning using sentence embeddings tends to outperform word level transfer. With transfer learning via sentence embeddings, we observe surprisingly good performance with minimal amounts of supervised training data for a transfer task. We obtain encouraging results on Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) targeted at detecting model bias. Our pre-trained sentence encoding models are made freely available for download and on TF Hub.},

JavaScript is also a dynamically typed language for which static type systems, notably Facebook's Flow and Microsoft's TypeScript, have been written. What benefits do these static type systems provide? Leveraging JavaScript project histories, we select a fixed bug and check out the code just prior to the fix. We manually add type annotations to the buggy code and test whether Flow and TypeScript report an error on the buggy code, thereby possibly prompting a developer to fix the bug before its public release. We then report the proportion of bugs on which these type systems reported an error. Evaluating static type systems against public bugs, which have survived testing and review, is conservative: it understates their effectiveness at detecting bugs during private development, not to mention their other benefits such as facilitating code search/completion and serving as documentation. Despite this uneven playing field, our central finding is that both static type systems find an important percentage of public bugs: both Flow 0.30 and TypeScript 2.0 successfully detect 15\%!.},

We describe implementation techniques, including the compile-time and run-time challenges that we faced (in particular, preserving the identity of objects). Measurement indicate that the performance of our implementation of structural dispatching is comparable to that of the JVM's standard invocation mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Social media data is notoriously noisy and unclean. Recipe collections and their manual categorization built by users are no exception. However, a consistent and transparent categorization is vital to users who search for a specific entry. Similarly, curators are faced with the same challenge given a large collection of existing recipes: They first need to understand the data to be able to build a clean system of categories. This paper presents an empirical study using machine learning classifiers (logistic regression and decision trees) for the automatic classification of recipes on the German cooking website Chefkoch.de. The central question we aim at answering is: Which information is necessary to perform well at this task? In particular, we compare features extracted from the free text instructions of the recipe to those taken from the list of ingredients. On a sample of 5000 recipes with 87 classes, our feature analysis shows that a combination of nouns from the textual description of the recipe with ingredient features performs best in the logistic regression model (48\% F1). Nouns alone achieve 45\% F1 and ingredients alone 46\% F1. However, other word classes do not complement the information from nouns. Decision trees constantly underperform the logistic regression, however, lead to an interpretable model. On a bigger training set of 50,000 instances, the best configuration shows an improvement to 57\% highlighting the importance of a sizeable data set. In addition, we report on the use of these feature vectors for similarity search and ranking of recipes and evaluate on the task of (near) duplicate detection. We show that our method can reduce the manual curation with precision@3 = 0.52.},

	abstract = {In order to support the maintenance of object-oriented software systems, the quality of their design must be evaluated using adequate quantification means. In spite of the current extensive use of metrics, if used in isolation, metrics are oftentimes too fine grained to quantify comprehensively an investigated aspect of the design. To help the software engineer detect and localize design problems, the novel detection strategy mechanism is defined so that deviations from good-design principles and heuristics are quantised inform of metrics-based rules. Using detection strategies an engineer can directly localize classes or methods affected by a particular design flaw (e.g. God Class), rather than having to infer the real design problem from a large set of abnormal metric values. In order to reach the ultimate goal of bridging the gap between qualitative and quantitative statements about design, the dissertation proposes a novel type of quality model, called factor-strategy. In contrast to traditional quality models that express the goodness of design in terms of a set of metrics, this novel model relates explicitly the quality of a design to its conformance with a set of essential principles, rules and heuristics, which are quantified using detection strategies.},

	abstract = {"God class" is a term used to describe a certain type of large classes which "know too much or do too much". Often a God class (GC) is created by accident as functionalities are incrementally added to a central class over the course of its evolution. GCs are generally thought to be examples of bad code that should be detected and removed to ensure software quality. However, in some cases, a GC is created by design as the best solution to a particular problem because, for example, the problem is not easily decomposable or strong requirements on efficiency exist. In this paper, we study in two open-source systems the "life cycle" of GCs: how they arise, how prevalent they are, and whether they remain or they are removed as the systems evolve over time, through a number of versions. We show how to detect the degree of "godliness" of classes automatically. Then, we show that by identifying the evolution of "godliness", we can distinguish between those classes that are so by design (good code) from those that occurred by accident (bad code). This methodology can guide software quality teams in their efforts to implement prevention and correction mechanisms.},

In this paper, the problem of regression testing is described in general terms and its characteristics are contrasted with those of testing. Regression testing can be grouped into progressive regression testing and corrective regression testing, depending on whether the specification is changed or not, respectively. The test cases can be grouped into five classes: reusable, retestable, obsolete, new-structural and new-specification test cases. A problem facing those conducting maintenance testing is to identify the proper test classes. The notion of regression testable is introduced as a way to measure the ease of retesting. Both the program design and the test plan design may affect the regression testability of a program. The testing set, testing number, regression number, stable and workable metrics are developed to measure the program and the test plan. We propose the Retest Strategy for performing corrective regression testing. The guiding principle of Retest is to view the regression testing problem as composed of two subproblems: the test selection problem and the test plan update problem, and to structure the retesting process into two phases: the test classificationphase and the test plan update phase.},

Yet, the existing reviews report few evidence supporting or refuting the effect of this development approach on test case quality. Lack of ability and skills of developers to produce sufficiently good test cases are also reported as limitations of applying test-driven development in industrial practice. Objective: We investigate the impact of test-driven development on the effectiveness of unit test cases compared to an incremental test last development in an industrial context. Method: We conducted an experiment in an industrial setting with 24 professionals. Professionals followed the two development approaches to implement the tasks. We measure unit test effectiveness in terms of mutation score. We also measure branch and method coverage of test suites to compare our results with the literature. Results: In terms of mutation score, we have found that the test cases written for a testdriven development task have a higher defect detection ability than test cases written for an incremental test-last development task. Subjects wrote test cases that cover more branches on a test-driven development task compared to the other task. However, test cases written for an incremental test-last development task cover more methods than those written for the second task. Conclusion: Our findings are different from previous studies conducted at academic settings. Professionals were able to perform more effective unit testing with test-driven development. Furthermore, we observe that the coverage measure preferred in academic studies reveal different aspects of a development approach. Our results need to be validated in larger industrial contexts.},

	abstract = {Background
Test-First programming is regarded as one of the software development practices that can make unit tests to be more rigorous, thorough and effective in fault detection. Code coverage measures can be useful as indicators of the thoroughness of unit test suites, while mutation testing turned out to be effective at finding faults.
Objective
This paper presents an experiment in which Test-First vs. Test-Last programming practices are examined with regard to branch coverage and mutation score indicator of unit tests.
Method
Student subjects were randomly assigned to Test-First and Test-Last groups. In order to further reduce pre-existing differences among subjects, and to get a more sensitive measure of our experimental effect, multivariate analysis of covariance was performed.
Results
Multivariate tests results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference between Test-First and Test-Last practices on the combined dependent variables, i.e. branch coverage and mutation score indicator, (F(2,9)=.52, p{\textgreater}.05), even if we control for the pre-test results, the subjects’ experience, and when the subjects who showed deviations from the assigned programming technique are excluded from the analysis.
Conclusion
According to the preliminary results presented in this paper, the benefits of the Test-First practice in this specific context can be considered minor.
Limitation
It is probably the first-ever experimental evaluation of the impact of Test-First programming on mutation score indicator of unit tests and further experimentation is needed to establish evidence.},

Although consumers are the single biggest contributor to this volume, little is known about the drivers of food waste in households. This exploratory study aims to investigate the role of food choices and other food-related activities in producing food waste. A survey of 244 Romanian consumers examined the influence of intentions not to waste food, planning and shopping routines, as well as moral attitudes and lack of concern towards wasting food, a subjective norm of disapproval towards food waste, and perceived behavioural control on consumers’ self-reported food waste. Results show that consumers’ planning and shopping routines are important predictors of food waste. Planning and shopping routines are determined by moral attitudes towards food waste and perceived behavioural control. This implies that in order to change consumers’ food waste behaviour, efforts should be directed towards providing consumers with skills and tools to deal with their food-related activities.},

	abstract = {Approximately 88 Million tonnes (Mt) of food is wasted in the European Union each year and the environmental impacts of these losses throughout the food supply chain are widely recognised. This study illustrates the impacts of food waste in relation to the total food utilised, including the impact from food waste management based on available data at the European level. The impacts are calculated for the Global Warming Potential, the Acidification Potential and the Eutrophication Potential using a bottom-up approach using more than 134 existing LCA studies on nine representative products (apple, tomato, potato, bread, milk, beef, pork, chicken, white fish). Results show that 186 Mt CO2-eq, 1.7 Mt SO2-eq. and 0.7 Mt PO4-eq can be attributed to food waste in Europe. This is 15 to 16\% of the total impact of the entire food supply chain. In general, the study confirmed that most of the environmental impacts are derived from the primary production step of the chain. That is why animal-containing food shows most of the food waste related impacts when it is extrapolated to total food waste even if cereals are higher in mass. Nearly three quarters of all food waste-related impacts for Global Warming originate from greenhouse gas emissions during the production step. Emissions by food processing activities contribute 6\%, retail and distribution 7\%, food consumption, 8\% and food disposal, 6\% to food waste related impacts. Even though the results are subject to certain data and scenario uncertainties, the study serves as a baseline assessment, based on current food waste data, and can be expanded as more knowledge on the type and amount of food waste becomes available. Nevertheless, the importance of food waste prevention is underlined by the results of this study, as most of the impacts originate from the production step. Through food waste prevention, those impacts can be avoided as less food needs to be produced.},

As exemplified by Chinese recipes on the Web, it is not easy/natural for people to use keywords (e.g. recipe names) to search recipes, since the names can be literally so abstract that they do not bear much, if any, information on the underlying ingredients or cooking methods. In this paper, we investigate the underlying features of Chinese recipes, and based on workflow-like cooking procedures, we model recipes as graphs. We further propose a novel similarity measurement based on the frequent patterns, and devise an effective filtering algorithm to prune unrelated data so as to support efficient on-line searching. Benefiting from the characteristics of graphs, frequent common patterns can be mined from a cooking graph database. So in our prototype system called RecipeView, we extend the subgraph mining algorithm FSG to cooking graphs and combine it with our proposed similarity measurement, resulting in an approach that well caters for specific users’ needs. Our initial experimental studies show that the filtering algorithm can efficiently prune unrelated cooking graphs without affecting the retrieval performance and the similarity measurement gets a relatively higher precision/recall against its counterparts.},

	abstract = {The Internet has revolutionised the way information is retrieved, and the increase in the number of users has resulted in a surge in the volume and heterogeneity of available data. Recommender systems have become popular tools to help users retrieve relevant information quickly. Food Recommender Systems (FRS), in particular, have proven useful in overcoming the overload of information present in the food domain. However, the recommendation of food is a complex domain with specific characteristics causing many challenges. Additionally, very few systematic literature reviews have been conducted in the domain on FRS. This paper presents a systematic literature review that summarises the current state-of-the-art in FRS. Our systematic review examines the different methods and algorithms used for recommendation, the data and how it is processed, and evaluation methods. It also presents the advantages and disadvantages of FRS. To achieve this, a total of 67 high-quality studies were selected from a pool of 2,738 studies using strict quality criteria. The review reveals that the domain of food recommendation is very diverse, and most FRS are built using content-based filtering and ML approaches to provide non-personalised recommendations. The review provides valuable information to the research field, helping researchers in the domain to select a strategy to develop FRS. This review can help improve the efficiency of development, thus closing the gap between the development of FRS and other recommender systems.},

A web-based user experiment using a matrix factorization algorithm applied to the MovieLens dataset was used to investigate the effect of recommendation set size (5 or 20 items) and set quality (low or high) on perceived variety, recommendation set attractiveness, choice difficulty and satisfaction with the chosen item. The results show that larger sets containing only good items do not necessarily result in higher choice satisfaction compared to smaller sets, as the increased recommendation set attractiveness is counteracted by the increased difficulty of choosing from these sets. These findings were supported by behavioral measurements revealing intensified information search and increased acquisition times for these large attractive sets. Important implications of these findings for the design of recommender system user interfaces will be discussed.},

However, appetites may vary, in the sense that users might seek healthy recipes today and look for unhealthy meals tomorrow. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in the food domain to diversify recommendations across different lists to ‘serve’ different users goals, compiled in a multi-list food recommender interface. We evaluated our interface in a 2 (single list vs multiple lists) x 2 (without or with explanations) between-subject user study (N = 366), linking choice behavior and evaluation aspects through the user experience framework. Our multi-list interface was evaluated more favorably than a single-list interface, in terms of diversity and choice satisfaction. Moreover, it triggered changes in food choices, even though these choices were less healthy than those made in the single-list interface.},

As similar ingredient composition can end up with wildly di erent dishes depending on the cooking and cu ing procedures, the di culty of retrieval originates from ne-grained recognition of rich a ributes from pictures. With a multi-task deep learning model, this paper provides insights on the feasibility of predicting ingredient, cu ing and cooking a ributes for food recognition and recipe retrieval. In addition, localization of ingredient regions is also possible even when region-level training examples are not provided. Experiment results validate the merit of rich a ributes when comparing to the recently proposed ingredient-only retrieval techniques.},

In this paper we try to shed light on this is-sue by collecting empirical evidence in favor and against the nega-tive effects of duplication on changeability. We go beyond the flat yes/no-question of harmfulness and present an explanatory model to show the mechanisms through which duplication is suspected to affect quality. We aggregate the evidence for each of the causal links in the model. This sheds light on the current state of duplication re-search and helps practitioners choose between the available mitiga-tion strategies.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the majority of web platforms in the Internet originate either from CMS to easily deploy websites or by web applications frameworks that allow developers to design and implement web applications. Considering the fact that CMS are intended to be plug and play solutions and their main aim is to allow even non-developers to deploy websites, we argue that the default hashing schemes rarely are modified. Also, recent studies suggest that even developers do not use appropriate hash functions to protect passwords, since they may not have adequate security expertise. Therefore, the default settings of CMS and web applications frameworks play an important role in the security of password storage. This paper evaluates the default hashing schemes of popular CMS and web application frameworks. First, we formulate the cost time of password guessing attacks and next we investigate the default hashing schemes of popular CMS and web applications frameworks. We then apply our framework to perform a comparative analysis of the cost time of password guessing attacks between the various CMS and web application frameworks. Finally, considering that intensive hash functions consume computational resources, we analyze hashing schemes from a different perspective. That is, we investigate if it is feasible and under what conditions to perform slow rate denial of service attacks from concurrent login attempts. Through our study we have derived a set of critical observations. We have discovered that many CMS and web application frameworks use outdated hash functions, arbitrary number of hash iterations, while there is a lack of password policies and salt. Notably, the popular WordPress still uses MD5 with low number of hash iterations. Overall, we believe that the security status of the hashing schemes of CMS and web application frameworks calls for changes to the default settings from an opt-in to an opt-out security policy. More security audits and official library implementations are also required to accelerate the adoption of memory hard functions both by policy makers and the industry.},

Performance measures include response time and service rate, memory usage, CPU utilization among others. A review of various studies indicates a close comparison among different web servers that included Apache, IIS, Nginx and Lighttpd among others. The results of various studies indicates that response time, CPU utilization and memory usage varied with different web servers depending on the model used. However, it was found that Nginx out performed Apache on many metrics that included response time, CPU utilization and memory usage. Nginx performance under these metrics showed that its memory (in case of memory) does not increase with increased requests. It was concluded that though Nginx out performed Apache, both web servers are powerful, flexible and capable and the decision of which web server to adopt is entirely dependent on the need of the user. Since some metric such as uptime (the amount of time that a server stays up and running properly) which reflects the reliability and availability of the server and also landing page speed was not included, we propose that future studies should consider uptime and landing page speed in the testing of web server performance.},

	abstract = {In modern IT industry, it is essential for web developers to know at least one battle-proven framework. Laravel is one of the most successful PHP framework in 2015, based on annual framework popularity survey conducted by SitePoint (SitePoint, The Best PHP Framework for 2015: SitePoint Survey Results, cited, 25.10.2015). 
 
There are several advantages and benefits of using web framework in general and Laravel in particular. Framework is a product of collective intelligence, comprising many robust libraries and convenient tools from other developers. They help to reduce most of the repetitive tasks and complex tasks in simple interface, which means developers can write less and do more with highest quality in a certain amount of time. Therefore, using a reliable framework also help to lower the development cost. 
 
This thesis is all about Laravel 5 and its features. Moreover, a web application is also created using Laravel 5 for demonstration},

A recommender system extracts personalized information relevant to users, thereby limiting the information overload. Our application, Buddy@Move is a hybrid travel recommender which brings together the features of content-based, collaborative and demographic filtering techniques. While travel imprints of the user cater to content-based filtering, resulting in personalized recommendations, the societal transactions provide input for the collaborative portion. The system will make use of the individual demographic information, to suggest what suits the user thereby making it more intelligent and user acceptable.},

A common way of computing such recommendations is to use a similarity function, which expresses how much alike two given objects are. Such similarity functions are usually designed based on the specifics of the given application domain. In this work, we explore how such functions can be learned from human judgments of similarities between objects, using two domains of “quality and taste”—cooking recipe and movie recommendation—as guiding scenarios. In our approach, we first collect a few thousand pairwise similarity assessments with the help of crowdworkers. Using these data, we then train different machine learning models that can be used as similarity functions to compare objects. Offline analyses reveal for both application domains that models that combine different types of item characteristics are the best predictors for human-perceived similarity. To further validate the usefulness of the learned models, we conducted additional user studies. In these studies, we exposed participants to similar item recommendations using a set of models that were trained with different feature subsets. The results showed that the combined models that exhibited the best offline prediction performance led to the highest user-perceived similarity, but also to recommendations that were considered useful by the participants, thus confirming the feasibility of our approach.},

	abstract = {Health nudge interventions to steer people into healthier lifestyles are increasingly applied by governments worldwide, and it is natural to look to such approaches to improve health by altering what people choose to eat. However, to produce policy recommendations that are likely to be effective, we need to be able to make valid predictions about the consequences of proposed interventions, and for this, we need a better understanding of the determinants of food choice. These determinants include dietary components (e.g. highly palatable foods and alcohol), but also diverse cultural and social pressures, cognitive-affective factors (perceived stress, health attitude, anxiety and depression), and familial, genetic and epigenetic influences on personality characteristics. In addition, our choices are influenced by an array of physiological mechanisms, including signals to the brain from the gastrointestinal tract and adipose tissue, which affect not only our hunger and satiety but also our motivation to eat particular nutrients, and the reward we experience from eating. Thus, to develop the evidence base necessary for effective policies, we need to build bridges across different levels of knowledge and understanding. This requires experimental models that can fill in the gaps in our understanding that are needed to inform policy, translational models that connect mechanistic understanding from laboratory studies to the real life human condition, and formal models that encapsulate scientific knowledge from diverse disciplines, and which embed understanding in a way that enables policy-relevant predictions to be made.

The nudges compared are the use of descriptive name labels (DNLs) for the most sustainable dish of a choice set (menu) and the decoy effect (DE), created by adding a less attractive decoy dish to a more attractive target dish with the goal of increasing the choice frequency of the target dish. In the literature, both nudges have been found to influence consumers’ choices. In the first study, six category names of sustainability indicators were deduced from a focus group. These were tested with 100 students to identify the most attractive DNLs. Study II, a randomized choice study (n = 420), tested the DE, the DNLs and a combination of the DNLs and the DE used on four different dishes in a university canteen. In study III, 820 guests of a business canteen voted during four weeks for the special meals of the following week (identical to the four choice sets displayed in study II). Results indicate that the combination of DNLs and the DE is not recommended for fostering sustainable food choices. Pure DNLs were more efficient in increasing the choice frequency of the more sustainable meal, whereas the decoy effect resulted in decreased choice frequencies. Regional and sustainable DNLs were favoured by consumers.},

	abstract = {How are food choices formulated? Which are the factors that mostly affect food choice? These questions are crucially important both for efforts in food innovation and for institutions that face consequences and costs of diets that are harmful to human health and to the environment. On these matters, several reports have been developed following the angel of various disciplines, focusing on the analysis of the factors affecting food choices. Large-scale research on consumption behaviours has neither stopped the growing number of unsuccessful products entering the market, nor provided adequate support for institutions that are taking elaborate actions towards promoting health-orientated behaviours. These preliminary remarks highlight the need to think about the approaches and categories with which research programmes on food choices should be updated. This article discusses the reasons why food choices are determined by beliefs and identity, are conditioned by social images that influence preferences by indicating to individuals what foods are ‘good’ and ‘right’; belong to the field of individual choice, and therefore, cannot be assimilated into medical prescriptions or merely reduced to a question of rules. Taste involves beliefs and identity as well as perceptions. This is why it has to be analyzed as a cultural and relational object. This paper aims to explore the complex mix of influences on food choice stressing that food choice is a matter of identity.},

In order to account for this neglect and to situate the fledgling body of social science scholarship that is starting to engage with food waste, the analysis here does a number of things. It explores the theoretical tendencies that have underpinned the invisibility of waste to the sociological gaze alongside the historical transitions in global food relations that led to the disappearance of concerns about food scarcity – and with them, concerns about food waste – from cultural and political life. It also sketches out some of the processes through which waste has recently (re-)emerged as a priority in the realms of food policy and regulation, cultural politics and environmental debate. Particular attention is paid to the intellectual trajectories that have complemented food waste's rising profile in popular and policy imaginations to call forth sociological engagement with the issue. With this in place, the stage is set for the individual contributions to this Sociological Review Monograph – papers that engage with food waste in a number of contexts, at a variety of scales and from a range of disciplinary perspectives. Together they represent the first attempt collectively to frame potential sociological approaches to understanding food waste.},

Management failures at key points of the cycle were identified. Subjects of study were commercialization procedures of fruit and vegetables before consumption, consumption proper and after-consumption disposal procedures for food scraps in the Brazilian context. Before consumption, the rate of lost fruit and vegetables stood at 16wt.\% of the total quantity commercialized. During consumption by residents, the waste rate of food amounted to 9wt.\% of all collected household garbage. In the after-consumption sector of the cycle, biodegradables represented 72wt.\% of all household garbage collected by official means in a typical Brazilian town. The numbers produced clearly identified landfill diversion of biodegradables as a management problem. The authors experimented with original proactive administrative procedures designed to set landfill diversion targets. The occurrence of wasted fruit and vegetables at the wholesaler and retailer levels was identified. Remedies were proposed and tested to reduce this waste by at least 50\%. In the after-consumption sector, the notion of divided garbage collection was developed and applied to test communities. It was shown that biodegradables may be collected separately from the rest of household waste. This resulted in a diversion potential of 100\% for biodegradables alone and 77wt.\% for all collected household waste. The study produced a formal policy proposal to municipal administrations to avoid the need for tipping of biodegradable material.},

	abstract = {The environmental impacts of five waste management scenarios for polylactic acid (PLA)-based bioplastics and food waste were quantified using life cycle assessment. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated the potential for a pretreatment process to accelerate the degradation of bioplastics and were modeled in two of the five scenarios assessed. The five scenarios analyzed in this study were: (1a) Anaerobic digestion (1b) Anaerobic digestion with pretreatment; (2a) Compost; (2a) Compost with pretreatment; (3) Landfill. Results suggested that food waste and pretreated bioplastics disposed of with an anaerobic digester offers life cycle and environmental net total benefits (environmental advantages/offsets) in several areas: ecotoxicity (−81.38 CTUe), eutrophication (0 kg N eq), cumulative energy demand (−1.79 MJ), global warming potential (0.19 kg CO2), and human health non-carcinogenic (−2.52 CTuh). Normalized results across all impact categories show that anaerobically digesting food waste and bioplastics offer the most offsets for ecotoxicity, eutrophication, cumulative energy demand and non-carcinogenic. Implications from this study can lead to nutrient and energy recovery from an anaerobic digester that can diversify the types of fertilizers and decrease landfill waste while decreasing dependency on non-renewable technologies. Thus, using anaerobic digestion to manage bioplastics and food waste should be further explored as a viable and sustainable solution for waste management.},

	abstract = {Food retailers are under increasing political and social pressure to reduce both the amount of food that they waste and the amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that their food retailing activities incur. For completeness, when assessing the ‘carbon footprint” of their business activities, food retailers should also included the greenhouse gas emissions caused by their disposal of waste food, which will vary with the waste disposal option used. However, there is lack of quantitative guidance for food retailers on the net GHG emissions that are incurred in the disposal of specific food types by the various disposal options available. Here, we calculate the net GHG emissions of eight different waste disposal options for five core food types using life cycle assessment, accounting for both emissions incurred in transport and processing, and those mitigated by the creation of useful products. We also assess the extent to which the embodied emissions in waste foods at the retail checkout can be mitigated by each disposal option. In addition to food specific results, we calculate mass-weighted averages using data from a mid-sized retail chain. We find a strong correlation between net emissions and the energy density of foods, and the following mass weighted disposal hierarchy (from best to worst, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions): donation of edible food to food banks; anaerobic digestion; conversion to animal feed; incineration with energy recovery; aerobic composting; landfill with gas collection and utilisation; landfill with gas collection and flaring; landfill without gas collection. If waste food from retailers is unfit for human consumption, to minimise greenhouse gas emissions it should be disposed of by conversion to animal feed or anaerobic digestion. For all food types, landfill is the worst disposal option.},

This has been a key driver for the establishment of new waste management options, particularly in the UK, which in the past relied heavily on landfill for the disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW in the UK is managed by Local Authorities, some of which in a less conventional way have been encouraging the installation and use of household food waste disposal units (FWDs) as an option to divert food waste from landfill. This study aimed to evaluate the additional burden to water industry operations in the UK associated with this option, compared with the benefits and related savings from the subsequent reductions in MSW collection and disposal. A simple economic analysis was undertaken for different FWD uptake scenarios, using the Anglian Region as a case study. Results demonstrated that the significant savings from waste collection arising from a large-scale uptake of FWDs would outweigh the costs associated with the impacts to the water industry. However, in the case of a low uptake, such savings would not be enough to cover the increased costs associated with the wastewater provision. As a result, this study highlights the need for policy intervention in terms of regulating the use of FWDs, either promoting them as an alternative to landfill to increase savings from waste management, or banning them as a threat to wastewater operations to reduce potential costs to the water industry.},
