	abstract = {This report documents progress against Courtauld 2025 and UN’s Sustainable Development
Goal (SDG) 12.3 food waste prevention targets, and also the Courtauld 2025 greenhouse gas
emissions (GHG) target1. The analysis suggests that the UK is on a trajectory to
achieve national and international food waste prevention targets, assuming rates
of progress between 2007 and 2018 are maintained, and that the strategies
WRAP has developed under Courtauld 2025, delivered through wide-ranging
partnerships and supported by industry are effective. When consumers and
businesses are reached and motivated to act significant reductions are achieved.
Much more action is needed to ensure that most people and organisations are
engaged and making the required changes.
WRAP, food businesses and other partners have delivered large-scale interventions to reduce
food waste across supply chains, and households for more than ten years (since 2007),
supported by UK Governments and enabled by a series of collaborative voluntary
agreements. This contributed to a decrease in post-farm gate total food waste between 2007
and 2015 of around a million tonnes. Whilst being recognised as world-leading2, progress in
reducing household food waste stalled between 2012 and 2015, and only modest reductions
were made in supply chain food waste. Courtauld 2025 was launched in 2016 with a new
collaborative approach to increase the resource efficiency of the food supply chain.
This report shows that food waste in the UK (post-farm gate) amounted to around 9.5 Mt in
2018, almost 480kt lower than in 2015 and almost 1.7 Mt lower than in the SDG12.3
baseline year. Food waste excluding inedible parts amounted to around 6.4 Mt in 2018, or
almost 70\% of the total.},

Text vectors is constructed based on the importance degree and improve the accuracy of text cluster and key topics extraction.

	abstract = {In the literature, various collaborative filtering approaches have been developed to perform an efficient recommendation on top of reducing the search cost of the customers. The recommender system methods are concentrated on improving the accuracy and to achieve that goal they focused on formulating complex similarity approaches and neglect the computation time in their model. Furthermore, in order to compute the similarity metric, most of traditional similarity measures have only considered co-rated items and overlooked the total rating vector of the user or item. However, considering only co-rated items to measure similarity metrics in recommender system is an insignificant approach to identifying appropriate nearest neighbors in relatively sparse datasets. Therefore, in this research, two new simple but effective similarity models have been developed by considering all rating vectors of users to classify relevant neighborhoods and generate recommendations in a lower computation time. Moreover, MovieLens, a well-known dataset used in recommender system domain, is involved here to validate the performance of the proposed model. It seems that the proposed relevant Jaccard similarity perform more accurately and effectively to generate well recommendation than other traditional similarity models.},

	abstract = {We present models for encoding sentences into embedding vectors that speciﬁcally target transfer learning to other NLP tasks. The models are efﬁcient and result in accurate performance on diverse transfer tasks. Two variants of the encoding models allow for trade-offs between accuracy and compute resources. For both variants, we investigate and report the relationship between model complexity, resource consumption, the availability of transfer task training data, and task performance. Comparisons are made with baselines that use word level transfer learning via pretrained word embeddings as well as baselines do not use any transfer learning. We ﬁnd that transfer learning using sentence embeddings tends to outperform word level transfer. With transfer learning via sentence embeddings, we observe surprisingly good performance with minimal amounts of supervised training data for a transfer task. We obtain encouraging results on Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) targeted at detecting model bias. Our pre-trained sentence encoding models are made freely available for download and on TF Hub.},
