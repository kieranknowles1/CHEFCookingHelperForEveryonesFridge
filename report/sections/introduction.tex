% Introduction
% The introduction provides a fuller overview of the work to be done than is given in the abstract and sets the scene for the detail provided in subsequent chapters.
% You may wish to draw on the background section written for your Terms of Reference, but the introduction should not simply reproduce parts of the TOR: you will develop
% a fuller understanding during the course of the project. The introduction is normally written (or at least finalised) at the end of the project, and is written
% retrospectively, i.e. it says what you did, not what you are going to do. This section is quite straightforward, but ensure that you have all the elements listed in
% the marking scheme. It is quite common for students to lose a mark or two by missing something out.
