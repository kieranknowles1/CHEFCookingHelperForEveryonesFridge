\section{The Need to Reduce Food Waste}
Globally, nearly one third of food produced is wasted with figures being highest
in industrialized countries, leading to unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions and
waste of natural resources~\cite{gustavsson_global_2011}. A significant proportion
of this wastage occurs at the household level, totalling approximately 50\% of all
food waste as of 2012~\cite{stenmarck_estimates_2016}. Overall, food waste contributes
to a significant amount of the global warming caused by the entire food supply
chain.~\cite{scherhaufer_environmental_2018}

\section{Algorithmics and Datasets}
The intention of the project is to create a system based on known algorithms and
datasets that can be used to reduce food waste. Because these algorithms and
datasets have been proven to work for recipe suggestion, the project will instead
focus on the implementation of the system and the evaluation of its effectiveness.

\section{The Primary Aim}
The primary aim of the project is to create a web application that can suggest
recipes based on the ingredients that the user already has available, and to
find similar recipes to those that have already been suggested.

This could be used to reduce food waste by aiding users in finding ways to use
ingredients that they already have, rather than having to buy new ingredients
and potentially waste what they already had.
