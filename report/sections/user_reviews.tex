    I tried the using the website first and I checked the ingredients I have on hand such as chicken,
    butter, etc. The first recipes it gave me is Spicy garlic steak - um garlic nor steak was on my list another was
    diet cola chicken well at least it got chicken right. Lol. I thought maybe the app was better but no it does the same thing.
    I tried another app with the same ingredient list I have and it popped up great recipes so I'll stick with it.
    This app is being Uninstalled. I don't recommend.

    Where are the recipes? I mean I like bacon, but not that much. I have tried many ingredients
    but outside of chicken eggs and bacon it seem no content is available. As an example,
    broccoli returns 1 result: for milkshake... 0\textunderscore o. Genuinely great idea but not with this
    implementation. Shame really.
