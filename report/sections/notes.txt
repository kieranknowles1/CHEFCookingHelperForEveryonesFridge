TODO: Move all of this to the report

Started by working on the back end in orderto give the front end a data source to work with
i created code to import the data set following the schema which would be expanded for later editions
I created some basic end points to retrieve information such as recipies and ingredients
this was enought to start working on the front end


once data was available I created the view recipie page which fetched info from the api
I designed the page to view the fridge
I went back to the back end to implement basic search functionality based on available ingredients
This coule be extended to meet the requirements
(near the top) I chose to work on the back and front end simultaneously so i always had something that was using each end point soon after it was implemented this meant basic testing was
being done before test cases were implemented
I added machine learning to the search - because the app is about ai recipie suggestion
I extended the search page to use the machine learning as well as the view recipe page to suggest recipes based on the ingredients in the fridge
I added a profile page which lets the user select preferences for food types and dietary requirements
The options there were fed back to the search function to filter results by specifications
the back end supports filtering for multiple users this was not linked to the front end due to time constraints
the filtering for multiple users wasn't esential for the mvp
Account creation was the last thing to be added based on a simple user name and password log in - why I chose this simplest to implement and security wasn't one
of the goals of research a commercial app would require some additional options for accounts or easier sign up methods such as single sign on
