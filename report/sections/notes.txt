TODO: Move all of this to the report

Started by working on the back end in orderto give the front end a data source to work with
i created code to import the data set following the schema which would be expanded for later editions
I created some basic end points to retrieve information such as recipies and ingredients
this was enought to start working on the front end


once data was available I created the view recipie page which fetched info from the api
I designed the page to view the fridge
I went back to the back end to implement basic search functionality based on available ingredients
This coule be extended to meet the requirements
I added machine learning to the search - because the app is about ai recipie suggestion
I extended the search page to use the machine learning as well as the view recipe page to suggest recipes based on the ingredients in the fridge
I added a profile page which lets the user select preferences for food types and dietary requirements
