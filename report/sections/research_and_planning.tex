\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Prior Work in Subject Area}
Stefan et al.\ found that \enquote*{the intention not to waste food does not have a
significant effect on reported food waste}. Instead, planning before shopping to
check what is already available was found to lead to a reduction in food waste.~\cite{stefan_avoiding_2013}

As planning before shopping is a key factor in reducing food waste, the need for a system
that tracks how much of each ingredient is available was identified. This would allow for
users to know plan meals based on what they already have, reducing the need to buy more ingredients
and thus reducing food waste.

\label{sec:overload_intro}While providing a user with variety of choices can improve their satisfaction
with the overall system, care must be taken to avoid information overload.
Bollen et al.\ found that offering a more limited set items predicted to be among a user's
highest rated, followed by a larger set of more varied items with lower rankings, led to
higher satisfaction on average.~\cite{bollen_understanding_2010}

Currently, the app shows all suggestions at once, but with further development, this could be
reduced to a more limited subset of the suggestions, with the option to view more if desired and is
discussed in further detail in Section~\ref{sec:choice_overload}.

The motivation for the \chef{} app is two-fold: to reduce the environmental impact of food waste and to
save costs for households by allowing them to collectively track what ingredients are available to them.

\subsubsection{Techniques Common to Food Reccomendation Systems}
There exist a broad range of techniques used by food recommendation systems, using both machine learning
and statistical models, the most popular method in existing studies being machine learning based on the
contents of recipes. Most of which were not personalized to the individual user.~\cite{bondevik_systematic_2024}

Among prior systems, the majority source their training data from textual data with the most commonly used
attributes being ingredients, cooking instructions, and the recipe title itself. There has been limited research
into combining multiple attributes of the recipe or giving attributes different weights.~\cite{chen_cross-modal_2017} These factors are often
considered to be merely a subject for future research or unimportant, which is believed to degrade the performance
of systems.~\cite{bondevik_systematic_2024}

\subsection{Recipe Name-based Suggestions}
\todo{Recipe Name-based Suggestions}

\subsubsection{Effectiveness Outside of Western Cuisine}
While western recipe names are typically constructed in a predictable format
that indicates what kind of recipe it is, this is not the case world-wide.
For example, Chinese recipe names often bear little resemblance to the contents
of the recipe itself.~\cite{wang_substructure_2008} This limits the effectiveness
of suggestions systems based on names and as such a more complex system as discussed
by Wang et al.\ would be needed.

\subsection{The Research Questions}

The goals of the \chef{} app is to provide a robust system that allows for users to track what ingredients they have in a
convenient manner, and to suggest recipes based on these ingredients, user preferences, dietary requirements, and to find
similar recipes that meet these criteria.

An additional goal is to evaluate how effectively similar recipes can be categorized based on their titles
and a sentence embedding model. This will be done by comparing the results of the model to a human judgement
of whether the suggested recipes are similar or not.

Finally, the recipe similarity model will be tested to see if it can also categorize recipes into meal types
based on the same criteria. This will again be evaluated against human judgement on whether the categorization
is correct and how often it is correct.

    A literature review has four main objectives:
    • Outlines the area you are researching --- what is the context of your work?

    • Explain why it matters --- what is the state of the art in your project area?

    • Summarises prior research that has been done in this area, particularly any key studies

    • Identifies any gaps in the literature to justify why your study is important and what it adds to the literature

    • Identifies a set of possible techniques/methods for solving the problem

    • Presents your research questions as the natural conclusion of the literature review (this is especially relevant for investigative projects)

    A literature review is *not* just a summary! It provides a firm foundation for your project work

    Identify and synthesize the existing papers on the topic

    2500--3000 words

    Organize papers while reading and make notes on them. Could include these notes as an appendix

    See the blackboard tool to evaluate how good the paper is (week 4 lecture)

    Can review software, but should be primarily academic work. Could also have a different section for software

    can still download the original file.

    How to structure the lit review chapter
        • Give it a structure
        • introduction giving scope
        • body with sections (see next slide)
    • conclusions
    • Identify themes
    • Give a succinct, careful account of each theme after assimilating all the ideas from the material
    • Discuss the work reviewed and give your perspective
    • Draw out conclusions and applications to your project

    How to structure the body of a lit review
    Consider three common structures:
    • Chronological: you write about related work according to when each paper was published.
    • Thematic: Thematic reviews of literature are organized around a topic or issue, rather than the progression of time. However,
    the progression of time may still be an important factor in a thematic review.
    • Methodological: A methodological approach differs from the two above in that the focusing factor usually does not have to do with the content of the material.
    Instead, it focuses on the “methods” of the researcher or writer. Use PEE structure (Point, Evidence, Explain) for each paragraph

    Other elements of a lit review chapter• Use evidence: A literature review must be backed up with evidence to show that what you are saying is valid.
    • Be selective: Select only the most important points in each source to highlight in the review. The type of information you choose to mention should relate
    directly to the review's focus, whether it is thematic, methodological, or chronological.
    • Use quotes sparingly: Some short quotes here and there are okay, though, if you want to emphasize a point, or if what the author said just cannot be rewritten in your own words.
    For example, you can quote certain terms that were coined by the author, not common knowledge, or taken directly from the study.
    • Summarize and synthesize: Remember to summarize and synthesize your sources within
    each paragraph as well as throughout the review.
    • Keep your voice: While the literature review presents others' ideas, your voice (the writer's) should remain front and centre.
    For example, weave references to other sources into your text, but you can still maintain your voice by starting and ending the paragraph with your ideas and
    your own words. The sources then act as a way of supporting what you are saying.• Use caution when paraphrasing: When paraphrasing a source that is not your own, be sure to
    represent the author's information or opinions accurately and in your own words. You still need to reference the source to avoid plagiarism.

    A literature review is not:
    • Describing very basic material etc.
    • Things you can assume your reader knows.
    • Justifying your choice of project topic
    • Normally, the introduction should cover this
    • Extensive history of computing / the Internet etc.
    • May wish to cover the development of ideas in your field, briefly, but consider relevance.
    • Write down everything you have learned.
    • All of these will suggest a weak project report

    Assume the reader has a basic knowledge of computing. Don't overuse jargon

    Common issues with lit reviews
    • Simply list each book/paper you have read with a summary of it
    • Quoting or closely paraphrasing long passages
    • Trying to cover many topics and give very little on each.
    • Find one source on each topic and stop there. You cannot build an argument around consensus \enquote*{literature states} with one source.
    • You can dismiss other approaches --- while demonstrating you are aware of them, e.g., \enquote*{I refer to [key term] as described by Creswell and Creswell (2018). For other common uses see Y (2014), and Z and X (2015)}.
    • No attempt at critical engagement of the literature provided. Not all literature is created equal or is equally as useful to you.
    • There is literature, but it lacks an argument. It's there, but not in support of any central argument.
    • Not using the literature to its full advantage. Pick key figures out of quotes:
    \enquote*{Smith (2011) agrees there is a large increase in figures in this area} OR
    \enquote*{Smith (2011) highlights the significance of the increase in the sector, asserting there was a 57\% increase within 5 years from 2012--2017}
    • No literature at all!

    Look at the academic phrase bank

\section{Competitor Analysis}\label{sec:competitor_analysis}
\todo{Need more here. Discuss the positives and negatives of each competitor.}

As part of the development of \chef{}, a competitor analysis has been performed on several existing solutions as part of research
into the problem domain. These solutions, while useful, had limitations as discussed below. The \chef{} app aims to address
these limitations and provide a more useful solution. The full list of competitors analysed is provided in Section~\ref{sec:competitors}.

SuperCook and MyFridgeFood both include feature an account system
that saves a user's list of available ingredients. Creating an account also allows for recipes to be favourited/bookmarked
which would then be shown on a dedicated page. SuperCook additionally shows which of the user's favourite recipes
can be made using available ingredients and which ingredients are missing. Both apps also use exclusively imperial
units for ingredients that are not understood by the majority of the world. The \chef{} app will use metric units by default
as it is targeted at a UK audience.

However, neither of these apps has a system for sharing pantries between users or specifying disliked ingredients. These features would be useful for households with multiple people.
Additionally, the only way to update available ingredients is to manually add or remove them which is time-consuming and tedious. There is no tracking for the quantity of
each ingredient, so there is no way to know if the user has enough of an ingredient without checking manually.

Neither app tracks which recipes have been made recently, so there is no way to avoid suggesting similar recipes to ones that have been recently made which could lead to
users getting bored with eating the same meals over and over.

MyFridgeFood has a feature to submit new recipes which are shared between all users. This is a useful feature as it allows for the community to contribute to the database
of recipes, however, these cannot be kept private to just one user.

\subsection{User Reviews}

A frequent complaint about MyFridgeFood was that it suggested
recipes that users lacked ingredients for. See figure~\ref{rev:review_missing_ingredients} for an example.

Another user found that MyFridgeFood gave them suggestions that were too similar to each
other. See figure~\ref{rev:review_lack_variety} for the review.

\section{Approach/Methodology}

This study is primarily into the algorithm used to suggest recipes. For this reason,
it was decided not to perform interviews or user testing. Instead, unit tests will
be the primary testing method.

\todo{Approach/Methodology}

\todo{Should go into each of the requirements, justify them, and discuss how they will be implemented}

\subsection{Choice of Language (FR\arabic{webappid})}\label{sec:language}

There are numerous languages and frameworks that can be used to build a web application including
Django (Python), Laravel (PHP), ASP.NET (C\#), and React (JavaScript/TypeScript), each of which has
its strengths and weaknesses.

Django is a Python web framework designed to include all the features needed for a web application such
as an ORM, authentication, and localization (which would have made NFR\arabic{localizationid}
easier to implement).~\cite{ghimire_comparative_2020} Additionally, Python is considered to be an
industry standard for machine learning tasks. However, it is considered to be a slow language\cite{srinath_pythonfastest_2017}
which, coupled with a lack of personal experience beyond simple scripts, made it an unattractive choice.

Laravel is a PHP web framework that functions similarly to Express, with routes being defined as a series of
middleware functions called when a request is made. User-facing pages are built using the Blade templating engine
which combines HTML with PHP in a neater syntax than standard PHP.~\cite{nguyen_building_2015,he_design_2015}
However, there were concerns about the suitability of PHP for machine learning tasks which would be needed for
\hyperref[req:similar_recipes]{FR\arabic{findsimilarid}}.

ASP.NET is a web framework based on the DotNet platform, which is primarily used with the C\# language.
Similar to Django, it supports templated views in a syntax that combines HTML with C\# code. The C\# language
itself uses a very similar syntax to Java and supports features such as nullable types and pattern matching
which can help to prevent bugs.~\cite{gao_type_2017} An external library, TorchSharp, can be used to run
PyTorch models in C\# which could serve as the backend for machine learning integration. However, despite
a familiarity with C\# from previous projects, the lack of experience with ASP.NET made it a less attractive
choice.

React is a JavaScript-based frontend library that is used to build user interfaces with a component-based,
HTML-like syntax. It features an event-driven architecture where components only update when their state changes,
such as in response to user input or an API request completing. This is efficient as it minimizes data transfer
between the client and server and only re-renders components that have changed.

Unlike the other frameworks considered, which run server-side, React is purely a client-side library and thus
needs to communicate with a backend server in order to fetch data. While React can fetch from any server-side
library, Express.js running on Node.js allows for both components to be written in the same language, simplifying
the development process by allowing code and library reuse.

Both React and Node are based on JavaScript, which is a dynamically typed language and thus gives no guarantees
as to the type of data that is being passed around the system. Instead, TypeScript can be used and compiled to
JavaScript to add static type checking to the system. This can prevent many bugs from being introduced that would
otherwise not be detected until later, especially with the checks for \texttt{null} and \texttt{undefined} enabled.~\cite{gao_type_2017}
For this reason, TypeScript was the language of choice for both React and Node. See Figure \ref{fig:type_check} for an
example of some issues that TypeScript can catch pre-emptively that JavaScript cannot.

\subsection{The Dataset (FR\arabic{sourcesid}, FR\arabic{flexibleid}, FR\arabic{trackamountsid})}\label{sec:data_pre_process}

It was decided to use a pre-existing dataset for the app in order to save time by removing the need to manually enter recipes
or create a web scraper to gather them, and is both a legal and ethical grey area.~\cite{murray_state_university_legality_2020}

The Recipe Box~\cite{lee_recipe_2017} dataset was initially considered, but later disregarded as the pre-scraped download only includes the
hashed versions of the source URLs and the scraping scripts no longer function due to changes in website design. This would have made
\hyperref[req:sources]{FR\arabic{sourcesid}} impossible to achieve.

An additional dataset that was considered was the Food.com Recipes and Interactions dataset~\cite{li_foodcom_2019}. However, this only includes
ingredient names and not amounts, which was insufficient to cover \hyperref[req:track_amounts]{FR\arabic{trackamountsid}}

In the end, RecipeNLG~\cite{bien_recipenlg_2020} was the dataset of choice for the \chef{} app. This contains approximately 2 million recipes
each with an ingredient list, a list of directions, and its source URL. This dataset was chosen as it includes all the features needed to
fulfill the requirements of the app and is available freely for research and educational purposes.

If the app proved to be successful, a different or custom dataset could be used as the app is designed
to be flexible in this regard, as the setup script is the only component to interact with the dataset. (FR\arabic{flexibleid})

See table~\ref{tab:recipenlg_row_format} for the information that is included with each recipe and that is imported into
the app's database during setup. The schema script for the database is located at \texttt{./app/backend/data/schema.sql}
in the project's Git repository and is not included in this report due to its length.

            NER & [\enquote*{brown sugar}, \enquote*{milk}, \ldots]\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabulary}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Data Pre-processing}
Many existing papers in the area do not pre-process their recipe data. Among those that do, the most
common methods are text cleaning and exclusion, with duplicate removal being a rare step to undertake.~\cite{bondevik_systematic_2024}

Duplicate removal was deemed the only pre-processing necessary for the \chef{} app due to similarity being
based on the recipe name (see Section~\ref{sec:recipe_similarity}). Therefore, any number of recipes with the same
name would be considered identical. Instead, the import script discards any recipe with a name that has been seen before.

The dataset used contains a number of meaningless and nonsensical recipes (see
figure~\ref{fig:bad_recipe_entry}), which were imported by the \chef{} system during setup.
A possible reason for these being included in RecipeNLG is that some
data sources scraped for it allow for user-submitted recipes, this contributes to
an unclean and noisy dataset.~\cite{kicherer_what_2018}

\begin{figure}[p]
    \centering
    \caption{\label{fig:bad_recipe_entry}A nonsensical recipe that was included in the dataset.}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figures/bad_recipe_entry.png}
\end{figure}

A possible solution for this issue would have been to further pre-process the data beyond what is
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:data_pre_process} to remove or correct noisy entries that would otherwise
harm the quality of the system.~\cite{garcia_big_2016} This was not considered a priority due to time
constraints and the fact that the noise had minimal impact on the system's results.

\subsection{Recipe Similarity Algorithms (FR\arabic{findsimilarid})}\label{sec:recipe_similarity}
\todo{Recipe Similarity Evaluation}

One method of evaluating the similarity of recipes is to compare their names which is considered to
give similar results to human judgement.~\cite{trattner_learning_2020,starke_serving_2021} This method
combined with a sentence embedding model was selected for the \chef{} app.

To generate embeddings, the pre-trained Universal Sentence Encoder~\cite{cer_universal_2018} was used.
This model can run in a Node.js environment via TensorFlow.js, and returns a 512-dimensional vector
for each input sentence that can then be compared using cosine similarity as used in the original
USE paper. This metric returns a normalized score between 0 and 1 for each pair of embeddings, with
higher scores indicating greater similarity. Overall, the metric provides higher precision and recall
than other metrics, making it an effective measure for ranked retrieval from queries.~\cite{ihajeer_comparison_2012}
