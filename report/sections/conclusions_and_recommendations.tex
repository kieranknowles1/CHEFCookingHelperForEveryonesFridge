% Conclusions and Recommendations
% An effective set of conclusions should not introduce new material. Instead, it should briefly draw out, summarize, combine and reiterate
% the main points that have been made in the body of the project report and present opinions based on them. The conclusions section should include a
% summary of what has been achieved, and of the main results of the project. To some extent this will involve summarizing aspects of the evaluation.

% The main conclusions will relate to the problem that you tackled: what answers and solutions did you find to your research question; what did you conclude
% about your hypotheses; what product did you build?  You should also sum up what you achieved, and how far your aims and objectives were met. You may also
% have drawn other conclusions from the work, perhaps about the effectiveness of methods or tools used.

% It is quite likely that by the end of your project you will not have achieved all that you planned at the start; and in any case, your ideas will have grown
% during the course of the project beyond what you could hope to do within the available time. The recommendations will focus on further work: this is where
% you describe your unrealized ideas. It is where you tell the reader what extra you wish you could have done to benefit this subject area. Try to look
% beyond the work that yourself have done to the subject context. A good set of recommendations can provide the basis for a future project. You may also
% have more general recommendations for other people working in this field.
