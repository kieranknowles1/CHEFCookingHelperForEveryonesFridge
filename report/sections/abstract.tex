This project aimed to create a web application that allows users to find a variety of recipes based on the ingredients they have
available, and to find similar recipes to those that were previously chosen. All done with the end goal of reducing food waste.
The application was built using a Node backend using Express and a React frontend, both written in TypeScript. The backend uses
a SQLite database to store all of its runtime data.

Requirements were gathered using a competitor analysis, a literature review, and use case analysis in the MoSCoW format before
being implemented. The backend was tested using Mocha and Supertest, with regression testing performed whenever an issue was
discovered. The frontend was tested manually to ensure that it met its requirements.

The final product was a prototype web application that met most of the core functional and non-functional requirements. The
application was designed to be extensible for future development, with the potential to be deployed publicly. However, certain
requirements were not implemented due to time constraints and would require further research before development. Overall, the
project has successfully satisfied its goals with the potential for future development.
