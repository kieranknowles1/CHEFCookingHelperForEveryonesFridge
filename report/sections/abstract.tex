% Abstract
% The purpose of an abstract is to provide the reader with the essentials of your report in a very condensed form. (In a published paper, it would provide a basis for the
% reader to decide whether to read it or not). This means it should briefly summarise the nature of the project, its context, what work was carried out and what the major
% findings or conclusions were. Key technologies or approaches used will normally be mentioned. The marking schemes explain exactly what should be in your abstract. It must
% be no more than one side in length. It relates to completed work â€“ it should not talk about what you are planning to do or the structure of the report. Write it last!
