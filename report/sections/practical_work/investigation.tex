% You should also discuss the investigation process. This does not mean that you have to repeat what you have already said about the design of your investigation,
% but you should comment on what happened during the investigation, e.g. how you conducted the experiments, how you collected data, or anything new or interesting
% that occurred, and perhaps add details that arose from events.  It’s possible that you had to adapt your approach in some way. If things when wrong, or in the event
% you took an approach different from the one you planned, then you can explain what happened, what you did about it, and why. (It isn’t expected that everything will
% go according to the design: how you deal with situations that arise can be a very interesting part of your report.) If you have produced deliverables, you can present
% and discuss these. Anything that would impede the flow of your chapter can be provided in the appendices or, if large, on your disk.
