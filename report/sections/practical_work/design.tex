% Good products, whether software or hardware, must be designed. It is not professional to hack out a solution! You must describe and provide a rationale for that design.
% The artefacts produced are models (and perhaps prototypes) that form part of your product. In the report you tell the reader about your design and discuss the design
% decisions. Throughout the design section you should justify your choices. Discuss the implications of making different design choices, and the reasons for the design
% that you have selected.

% The design chapter(s) should give a top-level view of how your product meets its requirements. For a software product, a good starting point is to describe the architecture
% of the software. (If your product is not software, what corresponds to the software architecture?)  For example, suppose you are going to produce a computer game that
% could be played across the web. This will involve some software concerned with the communications across the network, some software concerned with the specific game and
% some with aspects that could be common to many games. This suggests an architecture consisting of three subsystems. You may feel there are other possible designs. If so,
% discuss each and then tell the reader which you decided to follow, and why.

% Once you have selected a top-level design you can start to look at the details of each product component. You will produce design models as required by the development
% approach that you are following, and you will need to discuss your design decisions. For example, if you are using an object-oriented approach, you will probably describe
% and justify the important classes in your system. Design patterns are an area of increasing popularity and usefulness. Investigate making use of some. Explain which you
% have used and why.

% Make careful use of figures and diagrams when describing the design. Any diagrams are there to help the reader understand what you have done. They must form a minor
% part of the chapter. The full design documentation will be marked under the product marking part of the module.
% Another aspect of the design, which you may wish to write about, is the user interface. There is no point in simply relating HCI theory here, and merely describing
% or giving pictures of your screen designs is also inadequate: what the reader wants to know is how you have applied the theory. Justify your design choices in terms of
% usability principles, and illustrate them with a few carefully selected screen dumps.

% You may wish to discuss the design process that you followed. Theoretical descriptions of design processes are unlikely to be interesting here. How you applied the
% process and how it affected your product, might be.
