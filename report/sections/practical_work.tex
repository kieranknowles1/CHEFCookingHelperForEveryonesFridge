% Practical Work
% This is a description and discussion of the practical work you have carried out. You have defined how it is to be assessed in the Terms of Reference.
% How to organise the practical work chapters varies between projects, depending to the nature of your practical work. If you have conducted an investigative work
% without the aid of a product, you should organise the contents into three chapters as Design, Investigation and Results. However, if your practical work is mainly
% the development of a product, it makes more sense that you organise the chapters in terms of the product development life cycle, i.e., Design, Implementation and Testing.
% Please choose from below the appropriate section to read considering the nature of your own project.

% 	Projects focusing on the development of a product
% You should discuss the design, implementation, and testing of your product. There are sections on each of these below. If there were other activities involved in development,
% such as analysis modelling based on the requirements specification, or if your project involved other practical work such as an experiment using your product, you should also
% include these: say what you did and discuss any interesting decisions or problems. If your product does not fit this model – for example, a project whose product is an
% information strategy – this section should discuss the work needed to create that product.

% The narrative should especially identify areas of the work that were particularly interesting or difficult. Assume that the readership of the report will be computer
% literate individuals who will appreciate the problems you have tackled.
% Justify in detail the method(s) you chose to synthesise a solution to the problem. Discuss how your reading of the literature guided you in your work. You may wish to
% refer to supporting documentation in your discussion of the solution; these will be held in appendices to the report.
% In general, there should be neither bookwork nor theoretical material here. You should tell the reader what you did, why you did it and how you did it. Unless you have
% developed a worthwhile product or solved a challenging problem there will be little for you to say (and few marks to gain).
